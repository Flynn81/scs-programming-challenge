Thanks for reading.

CommitsController.java as a controller and you have to input your token or user name and password to be authorized
to access github api.

Commit.java works as an entity class.

CommitsServices.java, implements CommitServiceInterface, works as a service. Scalable.

Application.java. Spring boot application.

Thanks again.
